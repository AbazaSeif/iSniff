iSniff.py [updated release 2011-08-25]

SSL man-in-the-middle tool inspired by Moxie Marlinspike's sslsniff 0.8

Successfully tested against iOS < 4.3.5 devices vulnerable to CVE-2011-0228 
basic constraints validation issue (see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4824)
discovered by Gregor Kopf / Paul Kehrer

Written by hubert(a)pentest.com / @hubert3

Redirect SSL traffic from NAT'd clients to iSniff as follows:

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp --destination-port 443 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 2000

Linux/iptables is currently required for iSniff to determine the intended destination
of redirected traffic and generate working certs. Other platforms are not supported.

Any certificate trusted by iOS can be used as signing_cert - The example config below
uses an APNS cert extracted from an iPhone using 'nimble' (tool and cert not included). 
The certificate chain constructed with this config is similar to the one presented at 
https://issl.recurity.com. Website certs issued by other trusted CAs such as Verisign, 
Startcom, Comodo etc. also work.

Tested on Debian GNU/Linux 6.0 (kernel 2.6.32-5-686, Python 2.6.6)
Packages required: python-m2crypto
